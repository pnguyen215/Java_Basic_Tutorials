- We declared inner class in public class

- To access inner class, we will implement step by step:
	+ Create object public class contain of inner class,
	+ Access to inner class, (this case):
			"Person person = new Person();"
			"Person.Employee employee = person.new Employee();"

- We can extends an inner class into this public class
- Remember: can't Extends inner class from any class 
	
- Have fun :-)
