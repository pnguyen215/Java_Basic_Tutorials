- Anonymous Inner Class is class no name!
- Anonymous Inner Class is often subclass of abstract class or class implement interface,
- Save time to declare class, we can use "Anonymous Inner Class" to declare.



- We need review a lot of things, we learn!
 
 	+ When declared a class, using: "Class-Name <variable> = new Class-Name();"
 	+ We using double brackets to create new Constructor
 	+ But, with ANONYMOUS Inner Class, we will handle any method (override) from Interface and Abstract class
 	+ Example for this case: using type of constructor
 		* "PersonService personService = new PersonService() {

			@Override
			public String announce() {
				return "I am method of interface Class";
			}
		};"
 	 [In this above example, PersonService is interface class]
