- There are 2 ways to declared one thread:
- Let's begin!

	+ This class implements Runnable, after that, override run function. [1]
	+ This class extends Thread, after that, typing "run" and override this function. [2]

- To run my thread:
	+ [1]: Using this class create new object, after that, create new thread, by this way:
				
				"MyThread1 myThread1 = new MyThread1();"
				"Thread thread = new Thread(myThread1);"
				"thread.start();"
				
				
				
	+ [2]: Very easy! We only create new object from this class, by this way:
	
				"MyThread2 myThread2 = new MyThread2();"
				"myThread2.start();"
